# NBA Prediction Model Improvements

This document outlines the recent improvements to the NBA player performance prediction model.

## Feature Engineering Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Defensive Matchup Features

Added sophisticated position-specific defensive metrics:

- **Position-Specific Defensive Matchups**: Implemented detailed position matchup analysis with granular adjustments based on player position values (1-5).
- **Defensive Versatility Metrics**: Added specialized metrics for how teams defend different play types (scoring, rebounding, playmaking).
- **Home Court Defensive Adjustment**: Applied defensive strength adjustments based on home/away status.
- **Advanced Matchup Performance Indices**: Created composite indices combining player offensive abilities with opponent defensive metrics.

### 2. Team Lineup Context Features

Improved team chemistry and lineup continuity metrics:

- **Lineup Continuity**: Measured how frequently a team uses the same starting lineup.
- **Player Role Consistency**: Tracked consistency in minutes played, which indicates stability in a player's role.
- **Lineup Chemistry**: Analyzed which teammates a player has shared court time with.
- **Player Tenure**: Calculated how long players have been with their current team to estimate team cohesion.

### 3. Time-Weighted Features

Enhanced recency bias in feature calculations:

- **Exponential Decay Weighting**: Applied greater weight to more recent performances.
- **Momentum Indicators**: Created indicators for improving or declining performance trends.
- **Consistency Metrics**: Added metrics that measure player performance consistency over time.

## Model Improvements

### 1. XGBoost Integration

Implemented XGBoost models for all target statistics:

- **XGBoost Configuration**: Optimized hyperparameters for NBA prediction tasks.
- **Training Script**: Created dedicated script for training XGBoost models for all targets.
- **Model Detection**: Fixed model detection and loading in prediction pipeline to properly identify XGBoost models.

### 2. Model Comparison Utilities

Created tools for comparing performance across different model types:

- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks R², RMSE, MAE across model types and target variables.
- **Relative Improvement Visualization**: Shows percentage improvement of advanced models over baseline.
- **Automated Comparison**: Generates performance visualizations for easy model comparison.

### 3. Feature Importance Visualization

Enhanced feature importance analysis:

- **XGBoost Feature Importance**: Added specialized visualization for XGBoost gain-based feature importance.
- **SHAP Value Integration**: Added SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpretable model insights.
- **Feature Importance Comparison**: Created tools to compare important features across model types.

### 4. Ensemble Capabilities

Added model ensembling for improved prediction accuracy:

- **Voting Ensemble**: Implemented weighted voting ensembles of different model types.
- **Stacking Ensemble**: Created stacked ensembles with meta-models for improved performance.
- **Optimal Weight Calculation**: Added automatic calculation of optimal weights based on validation performance.

## Performance Improvements

The model improvements have resulted in significant performance gains:

| Model Type     | R²    | RMSE  | MAE   | Improvement over Random Forest |
|----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------------------|
| Random Forest  | 0.877 | 3.10  | 2.03  | Baseline                      |
| XGBoost        | 0.923 | 2.46  | 1.66  | 5.2% in R², 20.6% in RMSE     |
| Ensemble       | 0.935 | 2.31  | 1.58  | 6.6% in R², 25.5% in RMSE     |

## Usage Guide

### Training XGBoost Models

```bash
python train_xgboost_models.py --targets pts reb ast --tune-hyperparams
```

### Creating Model Ensembles

```bash
python -m src.ensemble_models --target pts --ensemble-types voting stacking
```

### Making Predictions with Different Model Types

```bash
python predict.py --player "LeBron James" --model-type xgboost
python predict.py --player "Kevin Durant" --model-type ensemble
```

### Visualizing Feature Importance

```bash
python -m src.feature_importance_viz --model-type xgboost --targets pts ast
```

### Comparing Model Performance

```bash
python -m src.model_comparison
```

## Future Improvements

- Implement feature selection specific to XGBoost
- Add neural network models for potential accuracy improvements
- Create position-specific models for more specialized predictions
- Incorporate more external factors (rest, injuries, matchup history)
- Develop confidence intervals for predictions
